# Tasks

These is an **_incomplete_** list of the tasks needed to complete the project. I'm making it up as I go along and will mark the ones completed with a ticked checkbox

- [Tasks](#tasks)
  - [The User should be able to](#the-user-should-be-able-to)
    - [Creating the Optimal Layout (Mobile Responsive)](#creating-the-optimal-layout-mobile-responsive)
    - [CSS Declaration Block](#css-declaration-block)
    - [Project Layout](#project-layout)

## The User should be able to

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Add/Remove products from the cart
- [ ] Edit product quantities in the cart
- [ ] Fill in all fields in the checkout
- [ ] Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- [ ] See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
- [ ] Shipping always adds $50 to the order
- [ ] VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- [ ] See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- [ ] **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### CSS Declaration Block

- Layout Properties (position, float, clear, display, z-index)
- Box Model Properties (width, height, margin, padding)

- Typography Properties (font-size, font-family, text-align, text-transform)

  display: ...;
  width: ...;
  height: ...;
  margin: ...;
  padding: ...;

  font-weight: ...;
  text-align: ...;

}
```

### Project Layout

- Layout-level patterns—repeating layout ideas and the overall grid
- Element-level patterns—headings, text sizes, fonts, spacing, icons, button sizes
- Color palette
- Structural ideas—the logical organization of sections, independent from the layout
- Everything else—ideas that are only present in one component
